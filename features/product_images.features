Feature: Product images validation
  As a user
  I want to ensure all product images load correctly
  So that product information is visually complete

  Background:
    Given the user is logged in as "standard_user"

  Scenario: All product images should load successfully
    When the user views the inventory page
    Then all product images should be loaded
